       "  'complaint_what_happened': 'Capital One reported my auto loan payments late several consecutive times. I have several credit cards with Capital One and all paid on time. Never late. I closed them because I noticed a pattern of discrimination. The higher my credit score went the more interest I paid. With my car loan, in XXXX, I was overpaying Capital One and caught them lying about what I owed. They repaired the issue. In the fall of XXXX they started overcharging me again, so I demanded they show proof. While I waited, they never disclosed their malfeasant actions toward me, they continued to mark me late. I researched all my credit reports and noticed they are all over the place, so I contacted all the XXXX and they informed me, they report only report what Capital One tells them, so why are the payments in different years and months??? Both Capital One and the Credit Bureaus, specifically XXXX stated it is ok and legal for them to be different because it happens all the time. I vehemently disagree for the following reason. \\nCredit scores permeate our entire lives, and the Credit Bureaus must be accurate because credit scores impact our QUALITY OF LIFE and PROSPERITY. \\nXXXXXXXX We need a good credit score to buy a home 2. A good score is needed to buy a car 3. Health Insurance premiums hinge on our credit score, not logical - it is criminal 4. Car Insurance uses our credit to offer us car insurance - it does not hinge on your driving record anymore, it depends on your credit score which is criminal. \\n5. To rent an apartment - your credit score is used. \\n6. Physicians are asking for credit report to obtain medical care - their reason - Dentist say, if you need major dental work, we must ensure your good for it. \\nCredit Scores permeate our lives, so for Capital One, XXXX, XXXX and XXXX to have such a casual attitude is dangerous. Our Federal Government must insert FINES and new REGULATIONS for Companies and Credit Reporting Agencies to ensure they are taking consumers credit reporting seriously. \\nPlease ask Capital One to remove the XXXX and XXXX of XXXX late payments off my credit reports. Thank you.',\n",

The very first thing I told her was that I had a lot of student loan debt and asked if the program would work for me. She said yes. I then told her that I had already had my credit run a few times and we needed to wait for my report to show the correct payments on my student loans. She said I can check XXXX and monitor it for the correct payments, then let her know so she could run my credit. I did this, then emailed her that XXXX did not show the correct payments yet and we should wait. She then said that she had already run my credit report. Not only did I not authorize this, but I explicitly stated I did not want to run it yet. Because of this, I have too many inquiries on my record and my score has dropped XXXX points in at least XXXX of the agencies. This is a measurable difference of over $ 100/month on my mortgage payment, a serious financial damage. This inquiry must be removed from my record.',\n",

My 3.75 % interest remain the same, although rates were down considerably during XX/XX/XXXX. \\nI am asking for an investigation of the last mitigation from my loan company whether I was within the 31 % of my income bracket. \\nWhat about being able to get a Tier 2 in house modification? \\nI had several hardships in the last two years, but I feel they are overlooked and have not been considered viable to getting a loan modification. \\nI am requesting a copy of my loan company DEED, to see if my title was accepted and delivered to my loan company from my original mortgage company, to show if my current loan company has legally obtained my deed. \\nI am requesting an investigation into whether my equity in my home has been used by my current loan company during my several requests for trying to negotiate ways to keep my home ... however, my equity has not been used to pay off my {$25.00}, 000 loan deficits. Why??????? \\nWhether my income was low or high, the I never was within the 31 % bracket to obtain a new modification, Why???? \\nWho are my loan company lawyers that are calling asking for personal information, but do not say who they are and who they represent? Who are the lawyers putting foreclosure information on my door, but do not say who they represent? Are they my loan company lawyers? \\nI am investigating whether my loan company is legally my loan company that I been paying since XXXX? Was my deed and title transferred through acceptance and delivery? Or was this another \" robo copy \\'\\' transfer? \\'\\' I am submitting a new Mortgage assistance application on XXXX, hoping my loan company will negotiate another modification, if my loan company is my legal mortgage loan company.',\n",

Calls followed the next day, where I again stated i did not know this person, and a third time, where I was accused of lying about having spoken to them the two previous days and when I told them to remove me was told by their representative that he was \" not there to take orders \\'\\'. The first call was well within their legal rights, but the next two days of calls were in direct violation of both the FDCPA and the TCPA, as they had no business relationship with myself, and when I tried to get information on their company the first several times I was hung up on, before finally getting someone who gave me their address and calling back a separate number to complain. Since getting this number I have received periodic obnoxious calls, both for the XXXX XXXX they were trying to contact and a XXXX XXXX, neither of whom i have ever met, seemingly never having my cellular number removed from the debts and getting brand new harassment every time the debt is sold for a new round of collection attempts. I recognize that there is no legal recourse to have my number permanently removed from the debt documents, but after establishing that I was not the debt holder on the first call all subsequent communications should have ended, in subsequent calls their use of a robocaller for someone with whom they have no business relationship is a direct violation of the TCPA.',\n",

       "  'complaint_what_happened': 'My wife and I visited the Chase Bank branch at XXXX, XXXX, KY on XX/XX/2017 around XXXX AM to open new checking accounts. We were prompted to open these checking accounts because Chase mailed and emailed us vouchers to receive {$300.00} for opening each account and personal friends had also referred us. XXXX was assigned to assist us in this matter. His first question to us was \" where do you work? \". After informing him that we are both were XXXX employees he asked us what we were going to do with our XXXX accounts. We advised him we would be keeping those accounts open. He then asked what we would be using our new Chase accounts for and I advised we would be using those accounts for miscellaneous savings, etc. It was then that XXXX XXXX advised he would not be opening the new accounts for us unless we closed our XXXX accounts and he tossed the Chase Voucher and our ID \\'s back across the desk to us ( RUDE! ). Confused, I questioned him further about this and he advised that he did not believe we were going to use our new Chase accounts and would just close them in 6 months. Upon clarifying that we would indeed keep the Chase accounts open and meet all of the requirements of the offer he stated that we would not be closing our XXXX accounts. He reiterated that he would not open the accounts for us and advised that he would get his manager XXXX involved. When XXXX XXXX arrived in the office to speak with us she advised that Chase would not be honoring the vouchers and would not open accounts for us because XXXX XXXX told her we were not planning to keep the accounts open and would not be \" using \\'\\' the accounts. I advised XXXX XXXX that we intended to meet the minimum requirements ( set up direct deposit and keep the account open for 6 months ) and would keep the accounts open further if we enjoyed the service we received from Chase during that time. I advised we intended to have direct deposit active on the accounts and would be moving money in and out of the accounts, but she did not seem to believe that was qualifying usage of the accounts. She then advised that I had previously opened a Chase account with a coupon about 10 years ago and did not keep it open. However, I believe that account was my primary checking account and I did keep it open for the required period of time and more. It was only when I moved out of state that I closed the account because I did not know if there would be Chase branches in my new area. I am deeply insulted by my experience in trying to open these new accounts and feel that my wife and I have been discriminated against because of our employment with another banking institute. In addition to this occurrence while my wife and I we waiting in the lobby to meet with XXXX XXXX we both were able to clearly observe XXXX \\'s business interactions with another customer who was in his cubicle/office which has an open door and clear glass windows. We were able to hear their entire conversation and at a certain point XXXX XXXX pulled that customer \\'s XXXX score. After pulling the XXXX score up on his monitor he swiveled the monitor around so that it was facing directly out the window into the lobby and I could clearly see the customer \\'s score was XXXX. Being in the banking business I understand well that this is a clear violation of Customer Confidentiality regulations and should be dealt with as such.',\n",

Notice of filing was provided to the Federal Loan employees when they called every week. They have continued to report late history on my credit report. A call was placed to them two weeks ago to address the issue with reporting negative payments. The rep stated they would correct as payments should have not been reported. When the reports were checked, it was noted that the accounts were reported as current under negative account information on XXXX, and showing 11 missed payments for the past two years on XXXX and XXXX reports. They should not be reporting negatively to any credit bureaus due to the active bankruptcy. The information should also be reported under the correct sections of the credit file. I am asking that the company report the information accurately on all the credit files as it has really added to the negative standard of my credit score',\n",

After one year making payments requested a buy-out amount and the information received for the buy-out total {$63000.00}. I called Ally auto asking why is the buy-out same the original purchase price? There answer was the payment paid does not deduct from the lease amount. This was surprise to me and the lease residual is at 49 % of the purchase price which the lease payment considered as a rent payment. I 've had leases with other banks and never experienced this before which each payment you make it does deduct from the purchase price. Ally is refusing to correct based on the guidelines and lease practices. I am not able to exchange the car for a better lease terms and by trading the car for another lease loan I will be in upside down situation. Could you please help with this matter?\",\n",

My husband is XXXX became permanently XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX. I am XXXX, permanently laid off from my job of eight years and have filed for XXXX. Pennsylvania statue of limitations to collect a debt is four years. Portfolio Recovery Associates started contacting us by phone and US mail sometime after the bankruptcy was dismissed. I told them our situation and the statute of limitations in Pennsylvania verbally and also have sent them a letter to cease and desist. They continued to call us and send us bill statements in the mail. We registered our telephone numbers with the Do Not Call List several years ago. Their behavior is considered harassment to us. Just recently, they also placed a collection derogatory remark on both of our credit reports without notifying us of such action. They were asked to remove the derogatory remarks from our credit reports, but they have not complied with the request. They have been asked verbally and in written communication not to contact us and that we are on the XXXX Not Call List. Portfolio Recovery Associates is a debt buyer of old debt for pennies on the dollar and then attempt to collect the full amount plus fees for debts that are past the statue of limitations for collecting. Please try to stop them from harassing us anymore and please try to get them to remove the derogatory collection comment from both our credit reports. Thank You.',\n",

This is the explicit reason I applied for this card this past XX/XX/XXXX. In XX/XX/2016 Barclays decided to change to terms and conditions they offered to new Military members.

After 10 month of having this card I received a notice in the mail stating that they could no longer honor the original terms and would begin accessing my account the annual fee of {$990.00}.

On XX/XX/XXXX, an overdraft fee was charged, and a few days later two other payments were returned, one other was returned and more fees were added. The Bank has failed to provide satisfactorily explanation of this change in policy. At the time of opening the new account, I was not given any notice or warning that new rules would apply. The Bank keeps adding extended overdraft fees. \\nIn my perception, the bank should have not honored any payments that were underfunded nor charged any fees for overdraft nor returned items because US Bank created a reasonable expectation through consistent behavior upon which reliance was reasonable. The Bank should bring the account to XXXX balance at its own expense. Further, the bank should refrain form a threatened charge off or any other report that will harm my credit history.',\n",

       "  'complaint_what_happened': 'This is a complaint against First Hawaiian Bank for its grossly incompetent management of its supposedly new and improved website. I \\'ve been a customer since approximately 2003, and I have never had problems with my account as bad as I have in the last few months with the roll-out of the new site. \\n\\nTonight, I spent one hour trying very hard to access my account online and then trying to transfer funds. Along the way, I made two phone calls to FHB Online where I spoke with a total of four representatives. Not one of them had even the slightest clue of how badly the site was performing. Specifically, every time I tried to perform ANY operation, the site automatically displayed an error message. When I tried to make an external transfer FHB Online stopped the attempted transaction and said it would send a code to my phone for verification. But FHB never called my phone -- even after an hour. The broken system did nearly the same thing when I tried to ( re ) add my XXXX account as an external account. FHB displayed a message that my XXXX account credentials were invalid. ( Yet these were the same credentials that I have been using on my XXXX account for years. So there was nothing wrong with my XXXX online ID, password, or pin. ) But far and away, the very worst issue was my truly sad experience with \" XXXX \\'\\' in the Online Banking Department. ( She said it was bank policy to refuse to provide her last name or even an employee number. ) Despite the incredible amount of time XXXX and I spent on the phone with her asking me the same questions over-and-over again, she could not understand that the FHB site was not performing as she expected it to. For example, she insisted there would be a blue arrow in front of my name. After asking me about this three times, I refused to answer the same question anymore. I had enough with the FHB site and its employees who were deeply in the dark about the site \\'s issues. \\n\\nThere is obviously something seriously wrong with the FHB website. It is not performing adequately. While I was on the phone with FHB, I had absolutely no problem accessing my XXXX and XXXX accounts. So the issue is not my connection -- and hopefully not even my XXXX browser. Clearly my access to funds through the site is blocked. But I am far more concerned with FHB \\'s employees \\' inability to troubleshoot, assist, or even acknowledge something is wrong.',\n",

I graduated from the program ( it was a graduate program ) XXXX years later, and began to pay the loan. In XX/XX/XXXX, I was home on XXXX and since I was working XXXX meant no income. I made arrangements for a forbearance. At no time was there any mention of increased interest or fees. However, when I began to work full time again in XX/XX/XXXX ( I actually began to teach as an adjunct in XX/XX/XXXX, but the pay was very low ), I began to make full payments again, and that was when I saw that my loan had ballooned to {$38000.00}!. I have been paying more than the monthly amount for years now, and the loan reduces very slowly. It does n't seem correct that after all this time, I am still paying this loan back in XX/XX/XXXX. Please look into my situation and see if something is incorrect. Thank you!\",\n",

Subsequently our account was locked for suspected fraud. We called Capital one verified our identity and the changes. Capital One requested supporting documentation from us consisting of drivers license copies, utility bills, and a copy of our Social Security card for each cardholder. We thought this an odd request especially since we have been using the card for over a year. We advised them that we were fine sending in everything with the exception of our Social Security card copies as we were not comfortable for security reasons with them having or storing a digital copy of our social security cards. We then sent in drivers license and utility bills for each card holder and with held the Social Security cards. For some reason After numerous calls Capital One refuses to remove the fraud hold on our card until we provide digital copies of our social security cards, which we will not do. This caused disruptions in our business so we opened another card with another company. \\n\\nWe called Capital One to close our account due to the fact that we were at an impasse. At the time we had a balance of approximately {$560.00}. We had accrued {$510.00} in cash rewards using the card for the last year. We requested to use the cash rewards we had earned to close out the account and fund the balance. Capital One now refuses to let us use our cash rewards until we send in our social security cards. We paid the balance and it seems we will now loose our cash rewards because we refuse to let Capital One have a copy of our Social Security cards. \\n\\nNo fraud was ever on this card! We made and authorized all changes. I have never had a credit card company hold me XXXX until I fax in a copy of my Social Security card.',\n",

They spoke with Personal Banker NMLSR ID : XXXX. XXXX. The XXXX presented the certified copy with raised seal of our Articles of Inc., tax ID letter, church check books, bank statements, and their driver and non-driver ID ( matching the signatures on the church articles of incorporation. Personal Banker NMLSR ID : XXXX was informed that on XX/XX/XXXX two men were not members of XXXX. had been allowed to put their name on our church bank accounts at the XXXX MD XXXX. Counter checks were created for their use. A check was written on XX/XX/XXXX to one of these men in the amount of {$900.00}. It is our understanding that they met with Personal Banker NMLSR : XXXX located at XXXX MD. XXXX. Banker NMLSR ID : XXXX contacted the Wells Fargo Bank legal department. The legal department stated that they would correct this matter after the articles of incorporation where taken to the Maryland State Department to be updated. The articles of incorporation were updated and returned to Banker NMLSR ID : XXXX approximately XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX XXXX NMLSR ID : XXXX sent a copy of the certified articles of Inc.. to the legal department. The control and proper names were applied to the account. After the banks error we requested to have a new bank account. Sadly Wells Fargo allowed the processing of a second counter check signed by one of the men who was not a member of our church in the amount of {$600.00} written on XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX we spoke with the Service Manager ( XXXX MD XXXX ) due to are bank cards not working properly. When we discovered that the reason for the trouble was that the Personal Banker NMLSR : XXXX located at XX/XX/XXXX MD. XXXX had removed our names from the account and replaced them again with these same men and added a woman who was also not a member of our church. \\nThe actions of Wells Fargo Bank allowing these people without proper documentation to be assigned to our account as signers. This has caused tremendous stress and hardship upon the church as a whole. We are greatly disappointed that these actions were allowed to happen. To this date we have not received any report of any investigation or any resolution to this matter.',\n",

As you may or may not be aware, XXXX is now closed due to an investigation into fraudulent practices. When it came time to repay my loan with XXXX, I did so as directed. In doing so, I noticed many times that no matter when I made the payment, the next statement would show up showing I owed late fees. I attempted to pay early so that I would n't accrue late fees and still they would show up on the following months statement. Phone calls to XXXX were not helpful, if responsive at all. \\nLater, the national recession hit and I got well behind on my loan. So much so that I had a garnishment put on my wages. XXXX, through Pioneer Credit Recovery, started me on what they called a rehabilitation program in order to bring my loans current. I finished the program and believed that my loan was current and that, as ( now ) Navient explained in their correspondence, all negative effects would be removed from my credit. However, apparently the rehabilitation program only affected my Federal loans and did not rehabilitate the past due private loans. These private loans still show as delinquent on my credit report. Navient made no attempt to inform me that the rehabilitation would n't repair my entire account. \\nEach month, I pay {$150.00} through automatic payment to Navient. Yet with them still showing that loans are delinquent, my balance never goes down and my credit is in major disrepair.\",\n",

Needing the money, I called Chase and asked them to deposit XXXX into my checking account and, shortly there after, they did so. Now, they are wanting the XXXX. back from my checking account. They say it was their error but they should n't have deposited the money because that checking account has n't been used to pay a Chase fee within 3 months, so could n't be approved for the transfer.. I had XXXX balances so there was no need to make a payment. They made this decision after they deposited the money into my account.They say they will pay the bank fees but where am I supposed to get the XXXX?. I do not have all of the XXXX left and what is there is allocated for checks and payments that have not cleared yet. I accepted their offer and borrowed this money in good faith and have spent many hours on the phone with various Chase reps and am that the account is active, has XXXX available credit, but they can not assign the money already borrowed to that account because it was n't used for 3 months. Surely they can lift the rule to cover their error, but they wo n't. The woman, who said she was a manager, gave me the fax number of Chase Executive Offices as my only recourse. So, I am contacting you. This is an AARP card, available only to XXXX. They are causing havoc in my life and do not care at all. Please help\",\n",

Number one occurred in 2014 when I was not adequately informed of my obligation to re-certify my income status. They did not make any effort to ensure that I completed it in time, and, as a result, {$6500.00} in interest capitalized and was rolled into my subsequent income-based repayment status. They did not adequately inform me ( 1 ) of my obligation to re-certify my income status by the deadline they provided and ( 2 ) of the repercussions of not doing so ( that my interest would capitalize and payment would skyrocket ). \\n\\nAt the time, I was told that there was nothing I could do about this. However, after seeing your lawsuit, I realized that I was wronged and misled. Thank you for your help in bringing this issue to light.',\n",

No explanation for the change to my repayment plan was provided in the letter. I have made all the monthly payments on time since XX/XX/XXXX and have never been notified by NAVIENT that I was delinquent on any monthly payment prior to XX/XX/XXXX or that I owed any late fees. I called the company for an explanation and a written accounting of why they are attempting to collect an amount in excess of the original repayment amount listed in the promissory note, but they offered no further details about why the change was being sought. Therefore, I continue to pay the original amount ( {$180.00} ) and have not paid the increased amount. However, since then I continue to receive letters and calls from NAVIENT informing me that I am now delinquent on my loan. \\n\\nThe terms of the loan are clearly listed in the original promissory note which I attached with my submission : {$15000.00} borrowed at 8.5 % interest to be repaid over 10 yrs ; 120 payments at {$180.00} with the first payment due in XX/XX/XXXX and the final payment due in XX/XX/XXXX ). The increased payment of {$260.00} demanded by NAVIENT is effectively a change in the original loan terms as documented in the promissory note and amounts to an overcharge of {$1000.00} on the loan.',\n",

We found out that the apartments were sold 2 months after we moved out. We have contacted the current owners and they say they have nothing on us. They told us they may have sold the debt to Quality Recovery Services. We were never notified that this was being placed as a debt. They only reason I found out is because I checked my credit report. Also I have disputed this on XXXX and I sent them a paper requesting documentation of who the managers were, who they maintenance workers were, who owned the complex, ect.

The short hand version is that I closed my account with them in XX/XX/XXXX and they failed to close the account, made a new \" rule \\'\\' to charge accounts without a minimum balance and started to charge me every month without ever calling me or sending me any bill in the mail, so I was unaware of these accumulating charges with an account I assumed was closed.

I paid out of pocket to have the items returned because I did not want the credit card ( Comenity Bank ) to be charged. This transpired less the 10 days from initial order. The credit card sent me a bill because XXXX did not report to the credit card the items where returned within the time so not to get a charge from the credit card. I was not successful when I tried to get this error resolved. Comenity Bank representative advise me to pay them although I did not have the items. This situation is very discouraging because I returned the items within the time so the credit card would not be charge, as well as the credit card fees for items that where returned.',\n",

I verified this by attempting to send a {$15000.00} XXXX dollar transaction to my friend in XXXX, which is around {$120.00} XXXX dollars. I was required to answer questions about the nature of our relationship, when I last saw her, where we met, how often I see her, and then was asked for the birthdates of several family members and a close friend and business associate. I provided this information truthfully, and patiently, during a XXXX minute call where all my information was given to an offshore call center agent. The end result was to be told that they would not send my transaction due to a decision by Moneygram Security, which is an algorithm, or amorphous intelligence appartus of a private or public-private nature, or some kind of unaccountable agency or group within the company, or perhaps merely a machine learning model. Bottom line, there was no rhyme or reason to the decision, and the company did not feel compelled to justify their actions in any manner. I recognize that most customers of these money transfer services are immigrants, and public policy currently opposes immigrants, but I am a native-born United States of America citizen who was trying to use this service to send slightly more than a XXXX dollars to a friend. If a money transfer business will not provide this service to Americans, it should not be allowed to do business in this country.',\n",

My mother received a voice mail from a XXXX XXXX. Once they got in touch with my mother we called them back to get a clear understanding of what they were calling about. We talk to a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, so he said. Once we began the conversation, he explained that a company sent my paper work to their Law Firm. We asked him several times who did the payday loan come from and after a while he told us Advance America. Next he went on to say I owed {$960.00}. I told him that did not sound right, because I had not borrowed that much from anyone. He said that included what I owed Advance America with fee \\'s. Next he asks if I wanted to pay this amount today and my mother interrupted him and asked for for a settlement amount. He gave the amount of XXXX. I asked him several times, why was n\\'t I notified by mail and he never gave an explanation. Next I told him I was going to call Advance America and he said \" IT \\'S NOT GOING TO MATTER BECAUSE THEY ARE GOING TO REFER YOU BACK TO US. \\'\\' So what I did to get him off the phone is to tell him to email me the paper work for what I owe and told him I would pay it, but I was n\\'t. I then contacted Advance America about my account and found out I only owed {$110.00}. I gave them the company name that was trying to get all this money out of me and they had never heard of them. Advance America gave me the number to the people that they said they sold my acct. to. They told me they sold my account on XXXX XXXX, 2017. They gave me the number to the company they sold it to and it was not XXXX, so I thought. Once I called XXXX different numbers it led my back to XXXX under a different name. They were operating under XXXX different names, as a Legal company. When the answering machine picked up to my surprise it was XXXX, the company Advance America said they knew nothing about. At this point XXXX called me back on XXXX/XXXX/2017 and told them I found out my balance from Advance America, so he made another offer of {$200.00}. I told him no, I was not paying what I did n\\'t owe. I did tell him I would pay the {$110.00} if they sent me another settlement letter. They never sent another XXXX. Today is XXXX/XXXX/2017 and they have not called or mailed or emailed anything. These people are scammers and must be closed and stopped. They threaten to garnish my pay check, without being sued or going to court. Told me I would be criminally charged. These messages were left on my mother phone by a person named XXXX XXXX and she also called my uncle and sister telling him the same things. XXXX XXXX made the same threats. These people called everyone in your family that they can contact. This is a tacked used to embarrass you, so their intended victim calls them and they can scare you into paying them extortion money. They work in teams, XXXX pretending to be the server, and the other pretending to be the verification person and another person pretending to be the Attorney name they use when they talk to you and send out settlement letters, which is XXXX XXXX Attorney at Law. Please stop these people and the Attorney that \\'s involved in this madness. By the way XXXX has a F rating with the BBB and the Attorney has aN A rating. Go figure. They also send this to read as your rights for them getting money out of you. XXXX. Instead of the FEDERAL LAW ( FDCPA ) REQUIREMENTS.',\n",

       "  'complaint_what_happened': \"I attended the XXXX which is located in XXXX, PA in XXXX of XXXX. I attended a class for XXXX months and finished in XXXX of XXXX. Which I believe this vocational/technical school no longer exists. Anyhow I had taken out a student loan with XXXX which is now navient. At first I was making payments towards my loan efficiently via mail and electronic on their website. But something did seem off now that this lawsuit against them has been filed. Thinking back while making my payments, every time I have received a bill, the amount seemed like I owed more, and the payments I was making did n't seem like they were taking effect with the balance of my amount due. At a point with making payments I declared a forebenece. In which I couldnt make payments because I was not working at the time and it was granted for 3 months. After 3 months I still was n't in the working field so they granted me with another 3 months of forebenece. After 6 months I have n't not received any type of letter or information regarding my loan. Then after a few years when XXXX converted into navient, I then received a letter regarding the conversion of the companies, but no information regarding my student loan and the amount I still owed. Maybe a few months to a year later I still did n't receive anything about my account, I then tried to log into my account online on their website. Since it has been awhile since I logged onto my account at this time I had to reset my password and everything. When I was trying to do so and providing the information that was needed, it kept telling me that there was no record of my information and I had no account. I believe this happened in XXXX I may be wrong. At this point I still havent received any information regarding my account until last year XXXX. I started receiving phone calls at random times of the day which I could n't answer due to being at work and everytime I did try and call back the office was closed. They basically were harassing me via phone but yet did not send anything via mail. Until they did send me a letter in the mail threatening me that they were going to be taking me to court or take a percentage out of my paycheck if I did n't make a payment. Still I had no information of how much I still owed. Then I did contact them via phone I set up a payment plan I started paying however I was not recieving a bill, receipts or anything. All I had was a phone number to make a payment. After a payment of {$260.00} I had made, I sensed that something was n't right so I did n't make another payment. Even with my first payment I have not received a receipt or any bill for my remaining balance. Now that I am working this company had found out what company I am working for and is taking a percentage out of my check that I work very hard for. Still till this day I have not received any type of letter regarding my account balance that 's due. Now just 2 weeks ago I filed my XXXX tax return. Today I just received a letter stating that this company will be interfering with my tax return payment. Which I am very highly upset, because I am very well depending on my tax return check for other personal reasons. For them to interfere with what I worked so hard for for a lousy company that is terrible for NOT sending any type of information about my account is disgraceful.\",\n",

I set up my account to automatically pay the bill every month through the Chase website from my Chase checking account. I paid this loan off early, this process closed my chase auto loan account and shut off access to it ( which makes sense you should n't need access to it ). My issue is that the automatic bill pay continued to draw the standard payment from my checking account after the account was closed. When I called Chase they informed me that I had to go into my account to cancel the automatic payments however since the account was closed I obviously could not do so. After an hour or so talking to various help desks they were able to cancel future payments to the closed account however the {$640.00} that they had drawn from my checking account was not returned. The Chase representative said it would take 20 business days to return the funds to my account. As Chase requires that their customers cancel recurring payments on accounts that they can not access and then bars customers access to their own funds, I believe that this would fall under the category of deceptive or unfair behavior.\",\n",

I have been a victim of fraud and contacted the FTC all these illegal actions are hurting me and my family. I have never filed for any bankruptcy at any time and do not know how all these accounts are being opened in my name fraudulently. This item did not occur as presented. Please contact the government agency that is reporting it to verify the detatils, if you do not remove it from my records provide me with written proof of every detail shown in your entry. This is some information I have requested from this credit reporting agency, and I 've yet to received any correspondence about the fraud to be removed.\",\n",

The correspondence also reports that I need to pay to have it removed from my credit report but what is interesting is that it is not on any of my credit reports which made me even more suspicious of this situation.These people are threatening to sue me and place a judgement on my account and wage garnishment as scare tactics which has to be illegal as I truly believe these to be false claims.If I supposedly owed this from XXXX then why in XXXX would they suddenly attempt to collect a so called debt that they claim I owe?

       "  'complaint_what_happened': 'I just viewed my results from experian and noticed that they re-inserted information that was previously corrected. My XXXX account/XXXX was reporting as accounts that are in good standing. I submitted a letter that I received from XXXX stating that my account was never paid 30 days late back in XX/XX/XXXX and to please correct my credit report. Experian corrected it the first month now I just noticed they put this account as \" accounts that are considered negative \\'\\' with a 30 day late payment in XX/XX/XXXX. This is not right. I had to contact XXXX to request this letter from them then send the letter over to experian to have this information corrected and now they are reporting it again in accounts that are potentially negative and should go to a positive status in the year XX/XX/XXXX. I just tried to dispute this information again with experian but the system would not allow me to do so. I am submitting this complaint about experian credit reporting agency because they are affecting my credit score by re-inserting an account into negative when I provided substantial proof to them that this account should be listed under \" ACCOUNTS THAT ARE IN GOOD STANDING \\'\\'. I never had a late payment with mandee \\'s credit card so the information experian is reporting on my credit report is wrong. Again I have to go through the process of submitting this letter to them again wait 30-45 days and hope they correct my credit report. I have spent so much time and effort and letters along with my time in trying to correct the incorrect information that is reporting on my credit file. Experian is a horrible credit reporting company.',\n",

       "  'complaint_what_happened': \"Yes, around a year ago possibly 10 months, I had saw a firearm on a website used to trade and sell firearms ( XXXX ). To make a long story short I tried to purchase the gun and sent the guy money via PayPal. You can send money two ways one way ( friends and family ) that way does n't charge the seller any fees as it is mostly used to just send money and PayPal does n't back that. Second ( goods and service ) if you send it this way you will have PayPal protection. Well I sent it via friends and family as the seller had instructed so I could buy the firearm cheaper. Well it turned out the guy was trying to scam me, I tried to contact him for days and he would n't respond. He then sent me a check that had more money than I was owed on it. And wanted the difference so I was trying to be a good guy but ended almost being scammed again. I payed using my XXXX card and almost lost that money but XXXX actually fought for me. But I am still actually missing the original XXXX dollars I had sent. I tried for months but XXXX would not fight for me to get my money from PayPal. PayPal said they would give it back but XXXX just gave up. I need help in getting that back.. Please\",\n",

I noticed on my report last year that they were saying the account was 30 days late and I disputed it, but nothing was done. I disputed it again and then they started reported it as paid as agreed and that I was paying every month. I do n't have anything from them, nor am I paying on any account. So they have it as a creditor and they also have it in my collection section showing that as a negative remark. They keep reporting this and it is impacting my credit score dramatically. They keep reporting it every single month on moth sides. I have sent a letter to XXXX and to the Credit Bureau and they continue to report it. My credit score dropped down when they added it to my current creditors as if I had credit with them.\",\n",

       "  'complaint_what_happened': 'On Tuesday, XXXX XXXX, I applied for a checking and savings accounts online with BBVA Compass Bank. I was accepted and asked to deposit {$25.00} for each account ( {$50.00} total ). The next day, I authorized BBVA Compass bank to withdraw the funds from my account. They withdrew the funds and verified this via email. In addition, I checked my account the verified that the funds had been withdrawn. Once that was completed, I was given the information to set up online. I did that by creating a user name and password. I was told that the funds would not be available for 2- 3 days and I would receive a debit card in 7-14 business days. Again, this communication was via email. I logged into my account via the web on Wednesday and Thursday. On Thursday, XXXX XXXX, I received an email stating that my user access had been disabled. There was no indication on the email as to why it had been disabled. However, the email stated that, \" If you believe this change was made in error, or if you have further questions, please contact ... \\'\\' I contacted the number in the email 3 times. The first call was answered but I had been on hold for nearly 10 minutes before a representative answered the line. By that time, I had to go ( I was on a break at work ). I called in the afternoon and waited 30 minutes on hold before hanging up. Finally, later that day, I was able to speak with a representative. Her name was XXXX and I explained to her from the beginning that I did not have the account number. This was because this information was not given in an email ( I understand completely ) and I had not received any written documentation at the time. She said that was fine and she would be able to verify me in other ways. Which she did. Once that was completed, she placed me on hold and said that more documentation was needed. She told me what information was needed and where to email it. During this interaction, I began to feel as if I was getting the run around. The representative told me they had not received payment from me. I explained to her that her company sent emails stating they had received funds. In addition, the funds were taken from my account. I began to feel uneasy and told her I wanted to cancel the accounts and receive a refund. I asked to speak with a supervisor. She placed me on hold and said that a supervisor would call me back in 48 hours. I questioned this because it was Thursday evening. I asked her if they made calls on the weekends and she said they did. On Friday, XXXX XXXX, I emailed the required documentation to BBVA and requested that the accounts be closed and I receive a refund immediately. I later received an email from XXXX XXXX stating that they had received my information and that my information had been forwarded it to \\'corporate investigations \\' for review but my concerns have not been addressed by this bank ( why the online access was disable and why they show they had received no funds ). In closing, I want to close these accounts and I want my money returned.',\n",

I noticed there was no automatic withdrawal on my bank account the next month ( month2 ) so I called the company who I have the arrangement with and gave them my payment information again. XXXX XXXX and XXXX I verify that the payment is withdrawn from my bank account. On Month XXXX I call the company I have the rehab agreement with to change my billing information, I am opening an account with a new financial institution and need to update my billing information. To my dismay, they inform me that I have n\\'t been making payments and need to re-commit to the rehabilitation program. I check online and clearly see that the correct amount is being withdrawn monthly at the correct dates using the automated process setup over the phone. The company informed me that even if my proof of payments was satisfactory for them that I still missed payments and would have to start the program again. This is unacceptable to me. \\n\\nMy original financial institution mailed me an official statement with the XXXX \" missing \\'\\' payment information on it. I \\'ve mailed a copy to the u.s. department of education and I \\'ve emailed a copy to the company I \\'m dealing with. \\n\\nI no longer trust this company. While in communication with them I \\'ve had to explain the entirety of my situation to many new representatives and supervisors because they do n\\'t understand details of my case.

I contacted the bankruptcy court and was informed that they did not provide the information listed on my credit report to Experian. I sent a certified letter to the address listed on my credit report for this public record and it was returned undeliverable.I have asked Experian to provide the name of the data furnisher or third party source who verified this information so that I can contact them directly. Experian refuses to provide this information. The date of filing, status, listed is completely untrue. This bankruptcy does not belong to me. I would like to see how this information was verified.',\n",

       "  'complaint_what_happened': \"We have had a checking account with Wells Fargo ( formerly Wachovia ) for nearly 15 years, during our last visit to the XXXX branch we were persuaded to take out a credit card which would 'even out expenses over the year '. I had to make a deposit of {$300.00} and was charged {$25.00} for the annual fee. When the card arrived I had a credit limit of {$300.00}, being the sum I paid in, which makes it a pre-paid account in my view. I have tried unsuccessfully for weeks to sort out the return of my {$300.00} and the closure of the account. \\nI spoke to their customer services two weeks ago and said I wanted to return the {$300.00} to my checking account and close the credit card account. As I had a bill to pay I needed it straight away and so said I would take it as a cash advance and the chap said the 3 % fee would be waived and the account would be closed, using the collateral account to pay the cash advance amount. \\n\\nI logged on my account today to see that the credit card account is still active with a balance of {$310.00} and a payment of {$40.00} overdue.\",\n",

I contacted Moving Matters, a moving company that specializes in moving seniors into retirement communities. They pack, help downsize, and their designers set up your apartment in the community. I had a cable box, modem and all the hookups needed for the above service. I assumed it was all packed and taken to the XXXX. I checked with the moving company and they said their records showed all items moved as promised. However they told me I would not have needed a cable box at XXXX as the cable was sourced through XXXX. If a resident had a flat screen no cable box was needed. I know I was using the same modem as I used in XXXX or one very similar. ( Model Name-XXXX, XXXX, XXXX ) I lived at XXXX very close to a year and for personal reasons decided not to stay after my grace period of 365 days. In all the time I lived there I was never asked about the cable box or any of the equipment issued to me in XXXX. I still maintained the internet and phone so XXXX had my address and contact information. \\n\\nI had lived in XXXX for at least four or five months when I got my first collection letter. This letter was my first knowledge of this debt. \\nDate XX/XX/XXXX ; Original Creditor-XXXX ; Account # XXXX I have the Modem ( Model Name-XXXX, XXXX, XXXX ) in question and a HDMI cable that is XXXX 's I think. I do n't know what happened to the cable box from XXXX. Common sense tells me it was in my apartment when XXXX set up my XXXX system. I was not missing anything other possessions that I had marked for the moving company. \\n\\nI have several problems with this claim. \\n\\n1. If it is customary to return these items and the information I received with the present system made it clear that is the case, why was I not asked for the XXXX Cable box, Modem and other hardware when I left XXXX? \\n\\n2. What was used to hook up my system in XXXX? I would like to see the records of the installation in XXXX to check the Serial # of the modem used against the serial # of the modem installed in XXXX. \\n\\n3. Did the installers see the XXXX cable box when they hooked up XXXX. XXXX has assured me that XXXX does all the installation. \\n\\nXXXX only handles the equipment they use to distribute the signal. So their technicians would not been involved in my apartment set up. \\n\\n4. Why was I not notified of this debt before it got to collection?\",\n",

       "  'complaint_what_happened': \"I transferred a balance to Chase Slate in the amount of {$1000.00} and chose to enroll in autopay from there website. After receiving confirmation that the auto pay was accepted i then found out that, due to data entry on the credit card company 's, part they did not accept my bank account number. They called me and told me there was a problem with the auto pay and my bank account was not accepted. They then told me to go back online and reconfirm that the data was correct. After i confirmed that my information was correct and paid the minimum amount due, the next month i received a statement telling me that only the minimum amount was due in the amount of {$30.00}. I then, at the same month and time frame received a recorded phone call from the company telling me i am delinquent on my account. When i called to inquire about the situation they told me again that my bank account was not accepted, that i was over the limit and also three months behind on my payments. \\n\\nI once again whet online to only confirm once again that my information was correct. I aslo confirmed that they discontinued my card and reported me for late payment to the three major credit report agencies. \\n\\nAlso, after i paid the late amount and total amount due that was behind, the next day i was informed by the auto phone with the company that i was still late. When i asked and inquired if they reported me for no fault of my own, the response was they were having problems with there computer system. \\n\\nI would like to report three accounts of fraud : 1. Sending a false or inaccurate monthly statement that stated only the minimum amount was due when they then informed me that i was three months in the rears. \\n2. Reporting me to the credit report agencies for late payment when they admitted they were having problems with there computer system and the error was clearly on their part. \\n3. Misuse of personnel information : my bank account number and intentional data entry error and/or gross negligence, in attempt to collect more money by falsifying the amount do with the intention to collect more money from me.\",\n",

       "  'complaint_what_happened': 'Capital One reported my auto loan payments late several consecutive times. I have several credit cards with Capital One and all paid on time. Never late. I closed them because I noticed a pattern of discrimination. The higher my credit score went the more interest I paid. With my car loan, in XXXX, I was overpaying Capital One and caught them lying about what I owed. They repaired the issue. In the fall of XXXX they started overcharging me again, so I demanded they show proof. While I waited, they never disclosed their malfeasant actions toward me, they continued to mark me late. I researched all my credit reports and noticed they are all over the place, so I contacted all the XXXX and they informed me, they report only report what Capital One tells them, so why are the payments in different years and months??? Both Capital One and the Credit Bureaus, specifically XXXX stated it is ok and legal for them to be different because it happens all the time. I vehemently disagree for the following reason. \\nCredit scores permeate our entire lives, and the Credit Bureaus must be accurate because credit scores impact our QUALITY OF LIFE and PROSPERITY. \\nXXXXXXXX We need a good credit score to buy a home 2. A good score is needed to buy a car 3. Health Insurance premiums hinge on our credit score, not logical - it is criminal 4. Car Insurance uses our credit to offer us car insurance - it does not hinge on your driving record anymore, it depends on your credit score which is criminal. \\n5. To rent an apartment - your credit score is used. \\n6. Physicians are asking for credit report to obtain medical care - their reason - Dentist say, if you need major dental work, we must ensure your good for it. \\nCredit Scores permeate our lives, so for Capital One, XXXX, XXXX and XXXX to have such a casual attitude is dangerous. Our Federal Government must insert FINES and new REGULATIONS for Companies and Credit Reporting Agencies to ensure they are taking consumers credit reporting seriously. \\nPlease ask Capital One to remove the XXXX and XXXX of XXXX late payments off my credit reports. Thank you.',\n",

The very first thing I told her was that I had a lot of student loan debt and asked if the program would work for me. She said yes. I then told her that I had already had my credit run a few times and we needed to wait for my report to show the correct payments on my student loans. She said I can check XXXX and monitor it for the correct payments, then let her know so she could run my credit. I did this, then emailed her that XXXX did not show the correct payments yet and we should wait. She then said that she had already run my credit report. Not only did I not authorize this, but I explicitly stated I did not want to run it yet. Because of this, I have too many inquiries on my record and my score has dropped XXXX points in at least XXXX of the agencies. This is a measurable difference of over $ 100/month on my mortgage payment, a serious financial damage. This inquiry must be removed from my record.',\n",

       "  'complaint_what_happened': 'NP Group first contacted me, on a cellular phone # which has been mine for around 8 years, about a debt, which was not mine, on XX/XX/2017 at XXXX by robocaller, I spoke to their representative, informing them that I had no knowledge of the XXXX XXXX they were seeking and asked to be removed from their system. Calls followed the next day, where I again stated i did not know this person, and a third time, where I was accused of lying about having spoken to them the two previous days and when I told them to remove me was told by their representative that he was \" not there to take orders \\'\\'. The first call was well within their legal rights, but the next two days of calls were in direct violation of both the FDCPA and the TCPA, as they had no business relationship with myself, and when I tried to get information on their company the first several times I was hung up on, before finally getting someone who gave me their address and calling back a separate number to complain. Since getting this number I have received periodic obnoxious calls, both for the XXXX XXXX they were trying to contact and a XXXX XXXX, neither of whom i have ever met, seemingly never having my cellular number removed from the debts and getting brand new harassment every time the debt is sold for a new round of collection attempts. I recognize that there is no legal recourse to have my number permanently removed from the debt documents, but after establishing that I was not the debt holder on the first call all subsequent communications should have ended, in subsequent calls their use of a robocaller for someone with whom they have no business relationship is a direct violation of the TCPA.',\n",

       "  'complaint_what_happened': 'My wife and I visited the Chase Bank branch at XXXX, XXXX, KY on XX/XX/2017 around XXXX AM to open new checking accounts. We were prompted to open these checking accounts because Chase mailed and emailed us vouchers to receive {$300.00} for opening each account and personal friends had also referred us. XXXX was assigned to assist us in this matter. His first question to us was \" where do you work? \". After informing him that we are both were XXXX employees he asked us what we were going to do with our XXXX accounts. We advised him we would be keeping those accounts open. He then asked what we would be using our new Chase accounts for and I advised we would be using those accounts for miscellaneous savings, etc. It was then that XXXX XXXX advised he would not be opening the new accounts for us unless we closed our XXXX accounts and he tossed the Chase Voucher and our ID \\'s back across the desk to us ( RUDE! ). Confused, I questioned him further about this and he advised that he did not believe we were going to use our new Chase accounts and would just close them in 6 months. Upon clarifying that we would indeed keep the Chase accounts open and meet all of the requirements of the offer he stated that we would not be closing our XXXX accounts. He reiterated that he would not open the accounts for us and advised that he would get his manager XXXX involved. When XXXX XXXX arrived in the office to speak with us she advised that Chase would not be honoring the vouchers and would not open accounts for us because XXXX XXXX told her we were not planning to keep the accounts open and would not be \" using \\'\\' the accounts. I advised XXXX XXXX that we intended to meet the minimum requirements ( set up direct deposit and keep the account open for 6 months ) and would keep the accounts open further if we enjoyed the service we received from Chase during that time. I advised we intended to have direct deposit active on the accounts and would be moving money in and out of the accounts, but she did not seem to believe that was qualifying usage of the accounts. She then advised that I had previously opened a Chase account with a coupon about 10 years ago and did not keep it open. However, I believe that account was my primary checking account and I did keep it open for the required period of time and more. It was only when I moved out of state that I closed the account because I did not know if there would be Chase branches in my new area. I am deeply insulted by my experience in trying to open these new accounts and feel that my wife and I have been discriminated against because of our employment with another banking institute. In addition to this occurrence while my wife and I we waiting in the lobby to meet with XXXX XXXX we both were able to clearly observe XXXX \\'s business interactions with another customer who was in his cubicle/office which has an open door and clear glass windows. We were able to hear their entire conversation and at a certain point XXXX XXXX pulled that customer \\'s XXXX score. After pulling the XXXX score up on his monitor he swiveled the monitor around so that it was facing directly out the window into the lobby and I could clearly see the customer \\'s score was XXXX. Being in the banking business I understand well that this is a clear violation of Customer Confidentiality regulations and should be dealt with as such.',\n",

After one year making payments requested a buy-out amount and the information received for the buy-out total {$63000.00}. I called Ally auto asking why is the buy-out same the original purchase price? There answer was the payment paid does not deduct from the lease amount. This was surprise to me and the lease residual is at 49 % of the purchase price which the lease payment considered as a rent payment. I 've had leases with other banks and never experienced this before which each payment you make it does deduct from the purchase price. Ally is refusing to correct based on the guidelines and lease practices. I am not able to exchange the car for a better lease terms and by trading the car for another lease loan I will be in upside down situation. Could you please help with this matter?\",\n",

My husband is XXXX became permanently XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX. I am XXXX, permanently laid off from my job of eight years and have filed for XXXX. Pennsylvania statue of limitations to collect a debt is four years. Portfolio Recovery Associates started contacting us by phone and US mail sometime after the bankruptcy was dismissed. I told them our situation and the statute of limitations in Pennsylvania verbally and also have sent them a letter to cease and desist. They continued to call us and send us bill statements in the mail. We registered our telephone numbers with the Do Not Call List several years ago. Their behavior is considered harassment to us. Just recently, they also placed a collection derogatory remark on both of our credit reports without notifying us of such action. They were asked to remove the derogatory remarks from our credit reports, but they have not complied with the request. They have been asked verbally and in written communication not to contact us and that we are on the XXXX Not Call List. Portfolio Recovery Associates is a debt buyer of old debt for pennies on the dollar and then attempt to collect the full amount plus fees for debts that are past the statue of limitations for collecting. Please try to stop them from harassing us anymore and please try to get them to remove the derogatory collection comment from both our credit reports. Thank You.',\n",

This is the explicit reason I applied for this card this past XX/XX/XXXX. In XX/XX/2016 Barclays decided to change to terms and conditions they offered to new Military members.

After 10 month of having this card I received a notice in the mail stating that they could no longer honor the original terms and would begin accessing my account the annual fee of {$990.00}.

When a withdrawal or other debit came in and there were non-sufficient funds, the payment was returned, without charging any fees, unless the resulting overdraft amount was negligible ( This occurred seven times between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX on the old account as shown by notices received in the mail attached herein ). \\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I opened a new account at US Bank ( XXXX XXXX ). On XX/XX/XXXX, an overdraft fee was charged, and a few days later two other payments were returned, one other was returned and more fees were added. The Bank has failed to provide satisfactorily explanation of this change in policy. At the time of opening the new account, I was not given any notice or warning that new rules would apply. The Bank keeps adding extended overdraft fees. \\nIn my perception, the bank should have not honored any payments that were underfunded nor charged any fees for overdraft nor returned items because US Bank created a reasonable expectation through consistent behavior upon which reliance was reasonable. The Bank should bring the account to XXXX balance at its own expense. Further, the bank should refrain form a threatened charge off or any other report that will harm my credit history.',\n",

       "  'complaint_what_happened': 'This is a complaint against First Hawaiian Bank for its grossly incompetent management of its supposedly new and improved website. I \\'ve been a customer since approximately 2003, and I have never had problems with my account as bad as I have in the last few months with the roll-out of the new site. \\n\\nTonight, I spent one hour trying very hard to access my account online and then trying to transfer funds. Along the way, I made two phone calls to FHB Online where I spoke with a total of four representatives. Not one of them had even the slightest clue of how badly the site was performing. Specifically, every time I tried to perform ANY operation, the site automatically displayed an error message. When I tried to make an external transfer FHB Online stopped the attempted transaction and said it would send a code to my phone for verification. But FHB never called my phone -- even after an hour. The broken system did nearly the same thing when I tried to ( re ) add my XXXX account as an external account. FHB displayed a message that my XXXX account credentials were invalid. ( Yet these were the same credentials that I have been using on my XXXX account for years. So there was nothing wrong with my XXXX online ID, password, or pin. ) But far and away, the very worst issue was my truly sad experience with \" XXXX \\'\\' in the Online Banking Department. ( She said it was bank policy to refuse to provide her last name or even an employee number. ) Despite the incredible amount of time XXXX and I spent on the phone with her asking me the same questions over-and-over again, she could not understand that the FHB site was not performing as she expected it to. For example, she insisted there would be a blue arrow in front of my name. After asking me about this three times, I refused to answer the same question anymore. I had enough with the FHB site and its employees who were deeply in the dark about the site \\'s issues. \\n\\nThere is obviously something seriously wrong with the FHB website. It is not performing adequately. While I was on the phone with FHB, I had absolutely no problem accessing my XXXX and XXXX accounts. So the issue is not my connection -- and hopefully not even my XXXX browser. Clearly my access to funds through the site is blocked. But I am far more concerned with FHB \\'s employees \\' inability to troubleshoot, assist, or even acknowledge something is wrong.',\n",

I graduated from the program ( it was a graduate program ) XXXX years later, and began to pay the loan. In XX/XX/XXXX, I was home on XXXX and since I was working XXXX meant no income. I made arrangements for a forbearance. At no time was there any mention of increased interest or fees. However, when I began to work full time again in XX/XX/XXXX ( I actually began to teach as an adjunct in XX/XX/XXXX, but the pay was very low ), I began to make full payments again, and that was when I saw that my loan had ballooned to {$38000.00}!. I have been paying more than the monthly amount for years now, and the loan reduces very slowly. It does n't seem correct that after all this time, I am still paying this loan back in XX/XX/XXXX. Please look into my situation and see if something is incorrect. Thank you!\",\n",

       "  'complaint_what_happened': 'We have a business card with Capital One ( XXXX ). We added an employee card and updated our email address. Subsequently our account was locked for suspected fraud. We called Capital one verified our identity and the changes. Capital One requested supporting documentation from us consisting of drivers license copies, utility bills, and a copy of our Social Security card for each cardholder. We thought this an odd request especially since we have been using the card for over a year. We advised them that we were fine sending in everything with the exception of our Social Security card copies as we were not comfortable for security reasons with them having or storing a digital copy of our social security cards. We then sent in drivers license and utility bills for each card holder and with held the Social Security cards. For some reason After numerous calls Capital One refuses to remove the fraud hold on our card until we provide digital copies of our social security cards, which we will not do. This caused disruptions in our business so we opened another card with another company. \\n\\nWe called Capital One to close our account due to the fact that we were at an impasse. At the time we had a balance of approximately {$560.00}. We had accrued {$510.00} in cash rewards using the card for the last year. We requested to use the cash rewards we had earned to close out the account and fund the balance. Capital One now refuses to let us use our cash rewards until we send in our social security cards. We paid the balance and it seems we will now loose our cash rewards because we refuse to let Capital One have a copy of our Social Security cards. \\n\\nNo fraud was ever on this card! We made and authorized all changes. I have never had a credit card company hold me XXXX until I fax in a copy of my Social Security card.',\n",

They spoke with Personal Banker NMLSR ID : XXXX. XXXX. The XXXX presented the certified copy with raised seal of our Articles of Inc., tax ID letter, church check books, bank statements, and their driver and non-driver ID ( matching the signatures on the church articles of incorporation. Personal Banker NMLSR ID : XXXX was informed that on XX/XX/XXXX two men were not members of XXXX. had been allowed to put their name on our church bank accounts at the XXXX MD XXXX. Counter checks were created for their use. A check was written on XX/XX/XXXX to one of these men in the amount of {$900.00}. It is our understanding that they met with Personal Banker NMLSR : XXXX located at XXXX MD. XXXX. Banker NMLSR ID : XXXX contacted the Wells Fargo Bank legal department. The legal department stated that they would correct this matter after the articles of incorporation where taken to the Maryland State Department to be updated. The articles of incorporation were updated and returned to Banker NMLSR ID : XXXX approximately XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX XXXX NMLSR ID : XXXX sent a copy of the certified articles of Inc.. to the legal department. The control and proper names were applied to the account. After the banks error we requested to have a new bank account. Sadly Wells Fargo allowed the processing of a second counter check signed by one of the men who was not a member of our church in the amount of {$600.00} written on XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX we spoke with the Service Manager ( XXXX MD XXXX ) due to are bank cards not working properly. When we discovered that the reason for the trouble was that the Personal Banker NMLSR : XXXX located at XX/XX/XXXX MD. XXXX had removed our names from the account and replaced them again with these same men and added a woman who was also not a member of our church. \\nThe actions of Wells Fargo Bank allowing these people without proper documentation to be assigned to our account as signers. This has caused tremendous stress and hardship upon the church as a whole. We are greatly disappointed that these actions were allowed to happen. To this date we have not received any report of any investigation or any resolution to this matter.',\n",

As you may or may not be aware, XXXX is now closed due to an investigation into fraudulent practices. When it came time to repay my loan with XXXX, I did so as directed. In doing so, I noticed many times that no matter when I made the payment, the next statement would show up showing I owed late fees. I attempted to pay early so that I would n't accrue late fees and still they would show up on the following months statement. Phone calls to XXXX were not helpful, if responsive at all. \\nLater, the national recession hit and I got well behind on my loan. So much so that I had a garnishment put on my wages. XXXX, through Pioneer Credit Recovery, started me on what they called a rehabilitation program in order to bring my loans current. I finished the program and believed that my loan was current and that, as ( now ) Navient explained in their correspondence, all negative effects would be removed from my credit. However, apparently the rehabilitation program only affected my Federal loans and did not rehabilitate the past due private loans. These private loans still show as delinquent on my credit report. Navient made no attempt to inform me that the rehabilitation would n't repair my entire account. \\nEach month, I pay {$150.00} through automatic payment to Navient. Yet with them still showing that loans are delinquent, my balance never goes down and my credit is in major disrepair.\",\n",

Needing the money, I called Chase and asked them to deposit XXXX into my checking account and, shortly there after, they did so. Now, they are wanting the XXXX. back from my checking account. They say it was their error but they should n't have deposited the money because that checking account has n't been used to pay a Chase fee within 3 months, so could n't be approved for the transfer.. I had XXXX balances so there was no need to make a payment. They made this decision after they deposited the money into my account.They say they will pay the bank fees but where am I supposed to get the XXXX?. I do not have all of the XXXX left and what is there is allocated for checks and payments that have not cleared yet. I accepted their offer and borrowed this money in good faith and have spent many hours on the phone with various Chase reps and am that the account is active, has XXXX available credit, but they can not assign the money already borrowed to that account because it was n't used for 3 months. Surely they can lift the rule to cover their error, but they wo n't. The woman, who said she was a manager, gave me the fax number of Chase Executive Offices as my only recourse. So, I am contacting you. This is an AARP card, available only to XXXX. They are causing havoc in my life and do not care at all. Please help\",\n",

       "  'complaint_what_happened': 'I believe I was wronged by Navient in several ways. Number one occurred in 2014 when I was not adequately informed of my obligation to re-certify my income status. They did not make any effort to ensure that I completed it in time, and, as a result, {$6500.00} in interest capitalized and was rolled into my subsequent income-based repayment status. They did not adequately inform me ( 1 ) of my obligation to re-certify my income status by the deadline they provided and ( 2 ) of the repercussions of not doing so ( that my interest would capitalize and payment would skyrocket ). \\n\\nAt the time, I was told that there was nothing I could do about this. However, after seeing your lawsuit, I realized that I was wronged and misled. Thank you for your help in bringing this issue to light.',\n",

No explanation for the change to my repayment plan was provided in the letter. I have made all the monthly payments on time since XX/XX/XXXX and have never been notified by NAVIENT that I was delinquent on any monthly payment prior to XX/XX/XXXX or that I owed any late fees. I called the company for an explanation and a written accounting of why they are attempting to collect an amount in excess of the original repayment amount listed in the promissory note, but they offered no further details about why the change was being sought. Therefore, I continue to pay the original amount ( {$180.00} ) and have not paid the increased amount. However, since then I continue to receive letters and calls from NAVIENT informing me that I am now delinquent on my loan. \\n\\nThe terms of the loan are clearly listed in the original promissory note which I attached with my submission : {$15000.00} borrowed at 8.5 % interest to be repaid over 10 yrs ; 120 payments at {$180.00} with the first payment due in XX/XX/XXXX and the final payment due in XX/XX/XXXX ). The increased payment of {$260.00} demanded by NAVIENT is effectively a change in the original loan terms as documented in the promissory note and amounts to an overcharge of {$1000.00} on the loan.',\n",

They told us we could move out and not to call code and they would give us something in writing and never did. We moved out and they did n't put it on our credit report for 2 months. We found out that the apartments were sold 2 months after we moved out. We have contacted the current owners and they say they have nothing on us. They told us they may have sold the debt to Quality Recovery Services. We were never notified that this was being placed as a debt. They only reason I found out is because I checked my credit report. Also I have disputed this on XXXX and I sent them a paper requesting documentation of who the managers were, who they maintenance workers were, who owned the complex, ect.

I \\'m assuming you can pull up the complaint from XX/XX/XXXX, which is why I \\'m sparing you the details of the issue. They should already be on file. The short hand version is that I closed my account with them in XX/XX/XXXX and they failed to close the account, made a new \" rule \\'\\' to charge accounts without a minimum balance and started to charge me every month without ever calling me or sending me any bill in the mail, so I was unaware of these accumulating charges with an account I assumed was closed.

I paid out of pocket to have the items returned because I did not want the credit card ( Comenity Bank ) to be charged. This transpired less the 10 days from initial order. The credit card sent me a bill because XXXX did not report to the credit card the items where returned within the time so not to get a charge from the credit card. I was not successful when I tried to get this error resolved. Comenity Bank representative advise me to pay them although I did not have the items. This situation is very discouraging because I returned the items within the time so the credit card would not be charge, as well as the credit card fees for items that where returned.',\n",

I verified this by attempting to send a {$15000.00} XXXX dollar transaction to my friend in XXXX, which is around {$120.00} XXXX dollars. I was required to answer questions about the nature of our relationship, when I last saw her, where we met, how often I see her, and then was asked for the birthdates of several family members and a close friend and business associate. I provided this information truthfully, and patiently, during a XXXX minute call where all my information was given to an offshore call center agent. The end result was to be told that they would not send my transaction due to a decision by Moneygram Security, which is an algorithm, or amorphous intelligence appartus of a private or public-private nature, or some kind of unaccountable agency or group within the company, or perhaps merely a machine learning model. Bottom line, there was no rhyme or reason to the decision, and the company did not feel compelled to justify their actions in any manner. I recognize that most customers of these money transfer services are immigrants, and public policy currently opposes immigrants, but I am a native-born United States of America citizen who was trying to use this service to send slightly more than a XXXX dollars to a friend. If a money transfer business will not provide this service to Americans, it should not be allowed to do business in this country.',\n",

My mother received a voice mail from a XXXX XXXX. Once they got in touch with my mother we called them back to get a clear understanding of what they were calling about. We talk to a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, so he said. Once we began the conversation, he explained that a company sent my paper work to their Law Firm. We asked him several times who did the payday loan come from and after a while he told us Advance America. Next he went on to say I owed {$960.00}. I told him that did not sound right, because I had not borrowed that much from anyone. He said that included what I owed Advance America with fee \\'s. Next he asks if I wanted to pay this amount today and my mother interrupted him and asked for for a settlement amount. He gave the amount of XXXX. I asked him several times, why was n\\'t I notified by mail and he never gave an explanation. Next I told him I was going to call Advance America and he said \" IT \\'S NOT GOING TO MATTER BECAUSE THEY ARE GOING TO REFER YOU BACK TO US. \\'\\' So what I did to get him off the phone is to tell him to email me the paper work for what I owe and told him I would pay it, but I was n\\'t. I then contacted Advance America about my account and found out I only owed {$110.00}. I gave them the company name that was trying to get all this money out of me and they had never heard of them. Advance America gave me the number to the people that they said they sold my acct. to. They told me they sold my account on XXXX XXXX, 2017. They gave me the number to the company they sold it to and it was not XXXX, so I thought. Once I called XXXX different numbers it led my back to XXXX under a different name. They were operating under XXXX different names, as a Legal company. When the answering machine picked up to my surprise it was XXXX, the company Advance America said they knew nothing about. At this point XXXX called me back on XXXX/XXXX/2017 and told them I found out my balance from Advance America, so he made another offer of {$200.00}. I told him no, I was not paying what I did n\\'t owe. I did tell him I would pay the {$110.00} if they sent me another settlement letter. They never sent another XXXX. Today is XXXX/XXXX/2017 and they have not called or mailed or emailed anything. These people are scammers and must be closed and stopped. They threaten to garnish my pay check, without being sued or going to court. Told me I would be criminally charged. These messages were left on my mother phone by a person named XXXX XXXX and she also called my uncle and sister telling him the same things. XXXX XXXX made the same threats. These people called everyone in your family that they can contact. This is a tacked used to embarrass you, so their intended victim calls them and they can scare you into paying them extortion money. They work in teams, XXXX pretending to be the server, and the other pretending to be the verification person and another person pretending to be the Attorney name they use when they talk to you and send out settlement letters, which is XXXX XXXX Attorney at Law. Please stop these people and the Attorney that \\'s involved in this madness. By the way XXXX has a F rating with the BBB and the Attorney has aN A rating. Go figure. They also send this to read as your rights for them getting money out of you. XXXX. Instead of the FEDERAL LAW ( FDCPA ) REQUIREMENTS.',\n",

       "  'complaint_what_happened': \"I attended the XXXX which is located in XXXX, PA in XXXX of XXXX. I attended a class for XXXX months and finished in XXXX of XXXX. Which I believe this vocational/technical school no longer exists. Anyhow I had taken out a student loan with XXXX which is now navient. At first I was making payments towards my loan efficiently via mail and electronic on their website. But something did seem off now that this lawsuit against them has been filed. Thinking back while making my payments, every time I have received a bill, the amount seemed like I owed more, and the payments I was making did n't seem like they were taking effect with the balance of my amount due. At a point with making payments I declared a forebenece. In which I couldnt make payments because I was not working at the time and it was granted for 3 months. After 3 months I still was n't in the working field so they granted me with another 3 months of forebenece. After 6 months I have n't not received any type of letter or information regarding my loan. Then after a few years when XXXX converted into navient, I then received a letter regarding the conversion of the companies, but no information regarding my student loan and the amount I still owed. Maybe a few months to a year later I still did n't receive anything about my account, I then tried to log into my account online on their website. Since it has been awhile since I logged onto my account at this time I had to reset my password and everything. When I was trying to do so and providing the information that was needed, it kept telling me that there was no record of my information and I had no account. I believe this happened in XXXX I may be wrong. At this point I still havent received any information regarding my account until last year XXXX. I started receiving phone calls at random times of the day which I could n't answer due to being at work and everytime I did try and call back the office was closed. They basically were harassing me via phone but yet did not send anything via mail. Until they did send me a letter in the mail threatening me that they were going to be taking me to court or take a percentage out of my paycheck if I did n't make a payment. Still I had no information of how much I still owed. Then I did contact them via phone I set up a payment plan I started paying however I was not recieving a bill, receipts or anything. All I had was a phone number to make a payment. After a payment of {$260.00} I had made, I sensed that something was n't right so I did n't make another payment. Even with my first payment I have not received a receipt or any bill for my remaining balance. Now that I am working this company had found out what company I am working for and is taking a percentage out of my check that I work very hard for. Still till this day I have not received any type of letter regarding my account balance that 's due. Now just 2 weeks ago I filed my XXXX tax return. Today I just received a letter stating that this company will be interfering with my tax return payment. Which I am very highly upset, because I am very well depending on my tax return check for other personal reasons. For them to interfere with what I worked so hard for for a lousy company that is terrible for NOT sending any type of information about my account is disgraceful.\",\n",

I set up my account to automatically pay the bill every month through the Chase website from my Chase checking account. I paid this loan off early, this process closed my chase auto loan account and shut off access to it ( which makes sense you should n't need access to it ). My issue is that the automatic bill pay continued to draw the standard payment from my checking account after the account was closed. When I called Chase they informed me that I had to go into my account to cancel the automatic payments however since the account was closed I obviously could not do so. After an hour or so talking to various help desks they were able to cancel future payments to the closed account however the {$640.00} that they had drawn from my checking account was not returned. The Chase representative said it would take 20 business days to return the funds to my account. As Chase requires that their customers cancel recurring payments on accounts that they can not access and then bars customers access to their own funds, I believe that this would fall under the category of deceptive or unfair behavior.\",\n",

The correspondence also reports that I need to pay to have it removed from my credit report but what is interesting is that it is not on any of my credit reports which made me even more suspicious of this situation.These people are threatening to sue me and place a judgement on my account and wage garnishment as scare tactics which has to be illegal as I truly believe these to be false claims.If I supposedly owed this from XXXX then why in XXXX would they suddenly attempt to collect a so called debt that they claim I owe? I 'm certain that if such a debt was owed, they are beyond the statute of limitations.The company 's information is as follows : XXXX ADVANCE AMERICA XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, CA XXXX XXXX XXXX\",\n",

       "  'complaint_what_happened': 'I just viewed my results from experian and noticed that they re-inserted information that was previously corrected. My XXXX account/XXXX was reporting as accounts that are in good standing. I submitted a letter that I received from XXXX stating that my account was never paid 30 days late back in XX/XX/XXXX and to please correct my credit report. Experian corrected it the first month now I just noticed they put this account as \" accounts that are considered negative \\'\\' with a 30 day late payment in XX/XX/XXXX. This is not right. I had to contact XXXX to request this letter from them then send the letter over to experian to have this information corrected and now they are reporting it again in accounts that are potentially negative and should go to a positive status in the year XX/XX/XXXX. I just tried to dispute this information again with experian but the system would not allow me to do so. I am submitting this complaint about experian credit reporting agency because they are affecting my credit score by re-inserting an account into negative when I provided substantial proof to them that this account should be listed under \" ACCOUNTS THAT ARE IN GOOD STANDING \\'\\'. I never had a late payment with mandee \\'s credit card so the information experian is reporting on my credit report is wrong. Again I have to go through the process of submitting this letter to them again wait 30-45 days and hope they correct my credit report. I have spent so much time and effort and letters along with my time in trying to correct the incorrect information that is reporting on my credit file. Experian is a horrible credit reporting company.',\n",

       "  'complaint_what_happened': \"Yes, around a year ago possibly 10 months, I had saw a firearm on a website used to trade and sell firearms ( XXXX ). To make a long story short I tried to purchase the gun and sent the guy money via PayPal. You can send money two ways one way ( friends and family ) that way does n't charge the seller any fees as it is mostly used to just send money and PayPal does n't back that. Second ( goods and service ) if you send it this way you will have PayPal protection. Well I sent it via friends and family as the seller had instructed so I could buy the firearm cheaper. Well it turned out the guy was trying to scam me, I tried to contact him for days and he would n't respond. He then sent me a check that had more money than I was owed on it. And wanted the difference so I was trying to be a good guy but ended almost being scammed again. I payed using my XXXX card and almost lost that money but XXXX actually fought for me. But I am still actually missing the original XXXX dollars I had sent. I tried for months but XXXX would not fight for me to get my money from PayPal. PayPal said they would give it back but XXXX just gave up. I need help in getting that back.. Please\",\n",

I noticed on my report last year that they were saying the account was 30 days late and I disputed it, but nothing was done. I disputed it again and then they started reported it as paid as agreed and that I was paying every month. I do n't have anything from them, nor am I paying on any account. So they have it as a creditor and they also have it in my collection section showing that as a negative remark. They keep reporting this and it is impacting my credit score dramatically. They keep reporting it every single month on moth sides. I have sent a letter to XXXX and to the Credit Bureau and they continue to report it.

       "  'complaint_what_happened': 'On Tuesday, XXXX XXXX, I applied for a checking and savings accounts online with BBVA Compass Bank. I was accepted and asked to deposit {$25.00} for each account ( {$50.00} total ). The next day, I authorized BBVA Compass bank to withdraw the funds from my account. They withdrew the funds and verified this via email. In addition, I checked my account the verified that the funds had been withdrawn. Once that was completed, I was given the information to set up online. I did that by creating a user name and password. I was told that the funds would not be available for 2- 3 days and I would receive a debit card in 7-14 business days. Again, this communication was via email. I logged into my account via the web on Wednesday and Thursday. On Thursday, XXXX XXXX, I received an email stating that my user access had been disabled. There was no indication on the email as to why it had been disabled. However, the email stated that, \" If you believe this change was made in error, or if you have further questions, please contact ... \\'\\' I contacted the number in the email 3 times. The first call was answered but I had been on hold for nearly 10 minutes before a representative answered the line. By that time, I had to go ( I was on a break at work ). I called in the afternoon and waited 30 minutes on hold before hanging up. Finally, later that day, I was able to speak with a representative. Her name was XXXX and I explained to her from the beginning that I did not have the account number. This was because this information was not given in an email ( I understand completely ) and I had not received any written documentation at the time. She said that was fine and she would be able to verify me in other ways. Which she did. Once that was completed, she placed me on hold and said that more documentation was needed. She told me what information was needed and where to email it. During this interaction, I began to feel as if I was getting the run around. The representative told me they had not received payment from me. I explained to her that her company sent emails stating they had received funds. In addition, the funds were taken from my account. I began to feel uneasy and told her I wanted to cancel the accounts and receive a refund. I asked to speak with a supervisor. She placed me on hold and said that a supervisor would call me back in 48 hours. I questioned this because it was Thursday evening. I asked her if they made calls on the weekends and she said they did. On Friday, XXXX XXXX, I emailed the required documentation to BBVA and requested that the accounts be closed and I receive a refund immediately. I later received an email from XXXX XXXX stating that they had received my information and that my information had been forwarded it to \\'corporate investigations \\' for review but my concerns have not been addressed by this bank ( why the online access was disable and why they show they had received no funds ). In closing, I want to close these accounts and I want my money returned.',\n",

I paid my dues on the items in the letters attached.

       "  'complaint_what_happened': \"We have had a checking account with Wells Fargo ( formerly Wachovia ) for nearly 15 years, during our last visit to the XXXX branch we were persuaded to take out a credit card which would 'even out expenses over the year '. I had to make a deposit of {$300.00} and was charged {$25.00} for the annual fee. When the card arrived I had a credit limit of {$300.00}, being the sum I paid in, which makes it a pre-paid account in my view. I have tried unsuccessfully for weeks to sort out the return of my {$300.00} and the closure of the account. \\nI spoke to their customer services two weeks ago and said I wanted to return the {$300.00} to my checking account and close the credit card account. As I had a bill to pay I needed it straight away and so said I would take it as a cash advance and the chap said the 3 % fee would be waived and the account would be closed, using the collateral account to pay the cash advance amount. \\n\\nI logged on my account today to see that the credit card account is still active with a balance of {$310.00} and a payment of {$40.00} overdue.\",\n",

I contacted Moving Matters, a moving company that specializes in moving seniors into retirement communities. They pack, help downsize, and their designers set up your apartment in the community. I had a cable box, modem and all the hookups needed for the above service. I assumed it was all packed and taken to the XXXX. I checked with the moving company and they said their records showed all items moved as promised. However they told me I would not have needed a cable box at XXXX as the cable was sourced through XXXX. If a resident had a flat screen no cable box was needed. I know I was using the same modem as I used in XXXX or one very similar. ( Model Name-XXXX, XXXX, XXXX ) I lived at XXXX very close to a year and for personal reasons decided not to stay after my grace period of 365 days. In all the time I lived there I was never asked about the cable box or any of the equipment issued to me in XXXX. I still maintained the internet and phone so XXXX had my address and contact information. \\n\\nI had lived in XXXX for at least four or five months when I got my first collection letter. This letter was my first knowledge of this debt. \\nDate XX/XX/XXXX ; Original Creditor-XXXX ; Account # XXXX I have the Modem ( Model Name-XXXX, XXXX, XXXX ) in question and a HDMI cable that is XXXX 's I think. I do n't know what happened to the cable box from XXXX. Common sense tells me it was in my apartment when XXXX set up my XXXX system. I was not missing anything other possessions that I had marked for the moving company. \\n\\nI have several problems with this claim. \\n\\n1. If it is customary to return these items and the information I received with the present system made it clear that is the case, why was I not asked for the XXXX Cable box, Modem and other hardware when I left XXXX? \\n\\n2. What was used to hook up my system in XXXX? I would like to see the records of the installation in XXXX to check the Serial # of the modem used against the serial # of the modem installed in XXXX. \\n\\n3. Did the installers see the XXXX cable box when they hooked up XXXX. XXXX has assured me that XXXX does all the installation. \\n\\nXXXX only handles the equipment they use to distribute the signal. So their technicians would not been involved in my apartment set up. \\n\\n4. Why was I not notified of this debt before it got to collection?\",\n",

       "  'complaint_what_happened': \"I transferred a balance to Chase Slate in the amount of {$1000.00} and chose to enroll in autopay from there website. After receiving confirmation that the auto pay was accepted i then found out that, due to data entry on the credit card company 's, part they did not accept my bank account number. They called me and told me there was a problem with the auto pay and my bank account was not accepted. They then told me to go back online and reconfirm that the data was correct. After i confirmed that my information was correct and paid the minimum amount due, the next month i received a statement telling me that only the minimum amount was due in the amount of {$30.00}. I then, at the same month and time frame received a recorded phone call from the company telling me i am delinquent on my account. When i called to inquire about the situation they told me again that my bank account was not accepted, that i was over the limit and also three months behind on my payments. \\n\\nI once again whet online to only confirm once again that my information was correct. I aslo confirmed that they discontinued my card and reported me for late payment to the three major credit report agencies. \\n\\nAlso, after i paid the late amount and total amount due that was behind, the next day i was informed by the auto phone with the company that i was still late. When i asked and inquired if they reported me for no fault of my own, the response was they were having problems with there computer system. \\n\\nI would like to report three accounts of fraud : 1. Sending a false or inaccurate monthly statement that stated only the minimum amount was due when they then informed me that i was three months in the rears. \\n2. Reporting me to the credit report agencies for late payment when they admitted they were having problems with there computer system and the error was clearly on their part. \\n3. Misuse of personnel information : my bank account number and intentional data entry error and/or gross negligence, in attempt to collect more money by falsifying the amount do with the intention to collect more money from me.\",\n",
